# HRnet: getting started

## What is it?

HRnet is an internal app to manage the employees inside a company. You can create an employee and see all the employees in the database via a data table. 
In the data table, you can sort the employee (birthdate, start date, city name, first name...) and also search for employees. 

This project is not final. We converted our actual app coded with jQuery libraries into a React App to see if we can improve performances and correct some bugs by creating our own libraries in React.

The library selected to be created was the "select" component.
